# IoT_automatic_spray
SW internship(arduino, Mbed)


	Developments


	Outline

We implement automatic spray system using interlock between the insecticide and Android application
which is operated on user’s smartphone. When user activates the application, 
the system compares current temperature and humidity with setpoint. 
If the measured value reaches to setpoint, the insecticide starts being sprayed periodically. 


	Motivation

India has many mosquitoes and has a population of many diseases associated with them 
because of the tropical climates. Especially, incidence of malaria per year is more than 1000 million 
and the way to avoid Malaria is only to keep away from mosquitoes. Also, according to acquaintances
who have been to India, they had very tough time in India because of dengue fever. 
So, the products that are able to combat the pests or allow to avoid them are easy to success in India. 
Considering these conditions of India, we came out with a system that would be helpful to resolve these difficulties.


	Development purpose & Expectation effectiveness

-prevent illness caused by pests
-reduce inconvenience by easy and quick access to controlling insecticide
-application for other field such as air freshener


	Major Function

-compare the input value (current temperature and humidity) with setting value 
(temperature and humidity where pests act the most actively)
-if the input value reaches to the range of setting value, the system allows insecticide to be sprayed periodically.
-user can check the residual amount of the insecticide on user’s smartphone and receive a push alarm when it is insufficient.
